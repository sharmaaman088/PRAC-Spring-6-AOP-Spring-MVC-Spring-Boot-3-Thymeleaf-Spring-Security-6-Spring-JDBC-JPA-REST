@Component - Another way to declare a bean is to mark a class with a @Component annotation. Doing this turns the class into a Spring bean at the auto-scan time.

@Autowired as an automatic plug that connects parts of your code without you manually creating objects.Imagine a lamp that needs electricity to work. Normally, you would:

    Find a power source (electricity).
    Manually plug in the lamp.

With @Autowired, it's like the lamp automatically connects to electricity without you doing anything!
